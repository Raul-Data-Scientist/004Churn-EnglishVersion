## Generalized Codes for Future Projects

I utilized this project to develop generalized codes for use in future projects. Therefore, you can observe in the codes that they can be easily applied to another dataset, provided it is well-preprocessed beforehand.

## Learning Experience

It was an excellent learning experience to carry out the work initially in Excel and then in Python, ensuring that the values matched those in Excel. The creation of the codes took the same amount of time as creating a new Excel sheet, yet these same codes will serve equally well for other possible projects.
